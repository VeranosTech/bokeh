"The Bokeh project encompasses two major components: the Bokeh package "
"source code, written in Python, and the BokehJS client-side library, "
"written in TypeScript. Accordingly, development of Bokeh is slightly "
"complicated by the explicit compilation step required to generate "
"deployable JavaScript."

"For this reason, in order to develop Bokeh from a source checkout, you "

"The Bokeh source code is stored in a `Git`_ source control repository. "

"Developing Bokeh requires installing some software packages that are not "
"Python packages (e.g. Selenium, NodeJS, etc.). To make this more "

"for the free `Anaconda`_ Python distribution. However, ``conda`` can also"
" install non-Python package dependencies, which helps streamline Bokeh "
"development greatly. It is *strongly* recommended that anyone developing "
"Bokeh also use ``conda``, and the remainder of the instructions will "
"assume that ``conda`` is available."
