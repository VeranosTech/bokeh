"Helping with documentation is one of the most valuable ways to contribute"
" to a project. It's also a good way to to get started and introduce "
"yourself as a new contributor. The most likely way for typos or other "
"small documentation errors to be resolved is for the person who notices "
"the problem to immediately submit a Pull Request to with a correction. "
"*This is always appreciated!* In addition to quick fixes, there is also a"
" list of `Open Docs Issues`_ on GitHub that anyone can look at for tasks "
