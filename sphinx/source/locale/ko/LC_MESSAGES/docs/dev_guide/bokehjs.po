"BokehJS is the in-browser client-side runtime library that users of Bokeh"
" ultimately interact with. This library is written primarily in "
"TypeScript and is one of the unique things about the Bokeh plotting "
"system."

"When researching the wide field of JavaScript plotting libraries, we "
"found that they were all architected and designed to integrate with other"
" JavaScript. If they provided any server-side wrappers, those were always"
" \"second class\" and primarily designed to generate a simple "
"configuration for the front-end JS. Of the few JS plotting libraries that"
" offered any level of interactivity, the interaction was not really "
"configurable or customizable from outside the JS itself. Very few JS "
"plotting libraries took large and streaming server-side data into "
"account, and providing seamless access to those facilities from another "
"language like Python was not a consideration."

"This, in turn, has caused the developers of Python plotting libraries to "
"only treat the browser as a \"backend target\" environment, for which "
"they will generate static images or a bunch of JavaScript."

"BokehJS is a standalone JavaScript library for dynamic and interactive "
"visualization in the browser. It is built on top of HTML5 canvas, and "
"designed for high-performance rendering of larger data sets. Its "
"interface is declarative, in the style of Protovis_, but its "
"implementation consists of a reactive scene graph (similar to Chaco_)."

"The CSS for controlling Bokeh presentation are located in a ``bokeh.css``"
" file that is compiled from several separate ``.less`` files in the "
"BokehJS source tree. All CSS classes specifically for Bokeh DOM elements "
"are prefixed with the string ``bk-``. For instance some examples are: "
"``.bk-plot``, ``.bk-toolbar-button``, etc."
