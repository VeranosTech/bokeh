"Bokeh can generate RGBA-format Portable Network Graphics (PNG) images "

"Responsive sizing_modes may generate layouts with unexpected size and "
"aspect ratios. It is recommended to use the default ``fixed`` sizing "
"mode. Also, glyphs that are rendered via webgl won't be included in the "
"generated PNG, so it's suggested to use the default ``Plot.webgl=True`` "

"Bokeh also supports replacing the HTML5 Canvas plot output with an SVG "

"The simplest method to manually export a SVG plot is to install a browser"
" bookmarklet from the New York Times called `SVG-Crowbar`_. When clicked,"

"Firefox in most cases."
