"Widgets are interactive controls that can be added to Bokeh applications "
"to provide a front end user interface to a visualization. They can drive "
"new computations, update plots, and connect to other programmatic "
"functionality. When used with the Bokeh server, widgets can run arbitrary"
" Python code, enabling complex applications. Widgets can also be used "
"without the Bokeh server in standalone HTML documents through the "
"browser's Javascript runtime."

"To use widgets, you must add them to your document and define their "
"functionality. Widgets can be added directly to the document root or "
"nested inside a layout. There are two ways to program a widget's "
"functionality:"

"Use ``bokeh serve`` to start the Bokeh server and set up event handlers "

msgid ""
"Event handlers are user-defined Python functions that can be attached to "
"widgets. These functions are then called when certain attributes on the "
"widget are changed. The necessary function signature of event handlers is"
" determined by how they are attached to widgets (whether they are passed "
"through ``.on_change`` or ``.on_click``)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/user_guide/interaction/widgets.rst:25
msgid ""
"All widgets have an ``.on_change`` method that takes an attribute name "
"and one or more event handlers as parameters. These handlers are expected"
" to have the function signature, ``(attr, old, new)``, where ``attr`` "
"refers to the changed attribute's name, and ``old`` and ``new`` refer to "
"the previous and updated values of the attribute. ``.on_change`` must be "
"used when you need the previous value of an attribute."

"Additionally, some widgets, including the button, dropdown, and checkbox,"
" have an ``.on_click`` method that takes an event handler as its only "
"parameter. For the Button, this handler is called without parameters. For"
" the other widgets with ``.on_click``, the handler is passed the new "
"attribute value."
