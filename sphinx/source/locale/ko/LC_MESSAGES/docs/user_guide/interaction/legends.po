":ref:`userguide_plotting_legends` added to Bokeh plots can be made "
"interactive so that clicking or tapping on the legend entries will hide "
"or mute the corresponding glyph in a plot. These modes are activated by "
"setting the ``click_policy`` property on a "
":class:`~bokeh.models.annotation.Legend` to either ``\"hide\"`` or "
"``\"mute\"``."

"Sometimes it is desirable to be able to hide glyphs by clicking on an "
"entry in a ``Legend``. In Bokeh this can be accomplished by setting the "
"legend ``click_policy`` property to ``\"hide\"`` as shown in the example "
"below:"

"Other times it is preferable for legend interaction to mute a glyph, "
"instead of hiding it entirely. In this case, set ``click_policy`` "
"property to ``\"mute\"``. Additionally, the visual properties of a "
"\"muted glyph\" also need to be specified. In general this is does in "
"exactly the same way as for "
":ref:`userguide_styling_selected_unselected_glyphs` or "
":ref:`userguide_styling_hover_inspections`. In the example below, "
"``muted_alpha=0.2`` and ``muted_color=color`` are passed to ``circle`` to"
" specify that muted lines should be drawn with a low alpha muted glyph."
