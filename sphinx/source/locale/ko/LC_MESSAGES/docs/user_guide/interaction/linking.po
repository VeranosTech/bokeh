"It's often useful to link plots to add connected interactivity between "
"plots. This section shows an easy way to do it using the |bokeh.plotting|"
" interface."

"It's often desired to link pan or zooming actions across many plots. All "
"that is needed to enable this feature is to share range objects between "
"|figure| calls."

"Now you have learned how to link panning between multiple plots with the "

msgid ""
"Linked brushing in Bokeh is expressed by sharing data sources between "
"glyph renderers. This is all Bokeh needs to understand that selections "
"acted on one glyph must pass to all other glyphs that share that same "
"source. To see how linked selection extends to glyph renderers that plot "
"only a subset of data from a data source, see "
":ref:`userguide_data_linked_selection_with_filtering`."

"The following code shows an example of linked brushing between circle "

"It is also possible to link values of Bokeh model properties together so "
"that they remain synchronized, using the ``js_link`` method. The example "
"below links a circle glyph radius to the value of a Slider widget:"

"The linking is accomplished in JavaScript, so this method works in "
"standalone Bokeh documents, or in Bokeh server applications."
