"Bokeh includes several layout options for arranging plots and widgets. "
"They aim to make it quick to create your interactive data applications. "
"At the heart of the layouts are three core objects Row, Column, and . "
"While you can use these models directly, we recommend using the layout "
"functions |row|, |column|, and ."

"The layout functions let you build a grid of plots and widgets. You can "
"nest as many rows, columns, and plots together as you'd like. In "
"addition, Bokeh layouts support a number of \"sizing modes\". These "
"sizing modes allow plots and widgets to resize based on the browser "
"window."

"Every item in a layout must have the same sizing mode for the layout to "

"layout functions as they help ensure that all the children of the row or "

"Widgets are HTML objects like buttons, and dropdown menus. They behave "
"slightly differently to plots and and putting them in a widgetbox is "
"necessary so that they can all work together. In fact, if you try and put"
" a ``Widget`` in ``Row`` or ``Column`` it will be automatically put into "
"a ``WidgetBox``. As a result, it's a good idea to wrap your own widgets "
"in a ``WidgetBox`` using as then you can be sure about how your widgets "
"are getting arranged."
