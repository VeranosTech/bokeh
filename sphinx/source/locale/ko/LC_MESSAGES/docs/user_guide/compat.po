"Bokeh generates JavaScript, and so Bokeh output can be combined with a "
"wide variety of JavaScript libraries, such as `PhosphorJS`_.  Listing "
"such libraries is beyond the scope of this document; it's best just to "
"try and see!"

"A major strength of Bokeh is that it copies your data from Python "
"directly into the browser, which makes it possible for the user to "
"interact with the represented data quickly and responsively, even without"
" a live Python process running.  However, for plotting millions or "
"billions of points, this strength can turn into a liability, because "
"current web browsers are very limited in how much data they can feasibly "
"work with.  Moreover, the visual representation of such large datasets is"
" often misleading due to `overplotting`_ and related issues."

"`Datashader`_ is a separately available Python library that pre-renders "
"even the largest datasets into a fixed-size raster image that faithfully "
"represents the data's distribution.  Datashader includes tools and "
"examples showing how to build interactive Bokeh plots that dynamically "
"re-render these images when zooming and panning in Bokeh, making it "
"practical to work with arbitrarily large datasets in a web browser."

"Datashader works well together with `HoloViews`_ (see below and "
"`this_example`_), which allows you to flexibly switch between datashaded "
"and non-datashaded versions of a plot, interleave datashader-based plots "
"with other Bokeh-based plots, and so on."

"Bokeh is designed to provide an enormous amount of power and flexibility "
"to the Python programmer, making it feasible to develop complex "
"visualization-focused applications for deployment on web browsers.  "
"However, for day-to-day work exploring and visualizing data, it can be "
"helpful to have a higher-level API on top of what Bokeh provides, to make"
" it simpler to do common visualization tasks without specifying each step"
" explicitly."

"`HoloViews`_ is a separately maintained package that provides a concise "
"declarative interface for building Bokeh plots. HoloViews is particularly"
" focused on interactive use in a Jupyter notebook, allowing quick "
"prototyping of figures for data analysis.  For instance, to build an "
"interactive figure with three linked Bokeh plots requires only one line "
"of code in HoloViews:"

msgid ""
"Adding overlaid plots, slider widgets, selector widgets, selection tools,"
" and tabs is similarly straightforward.  HoloViews objects can also be "
"rendered using a Matplotlib-based backend, which allows SVG or PDF output"
" not currently available for native Bokeh plots.  See the Holoviews "
"`Bokeh_Backend`_ tutorial for more details."
