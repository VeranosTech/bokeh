"Bokeh has started adding support for working with Geographical data. "
"There are a number of powerful features already available, but we still "
"have more to add. Please tell use your use cases through the `mailing "
"list`_ or on `github`_ so that we can continue to build out these "
"features to meet your needs."

"Bokeh plots can also consume XYZ tile services which use the Web Mercator"
" projection. The module :ref:`bokeh.tile_providers` contains several pre-"
"configured tile sources with appropriate attribution which can be added "
"to a plot using the :func:`~bokeh.models.plots.Plot.add_tile` method."

"Bokeh can also plot glyphs over a Google Map using the "

"`GeoJSON`_ is a popular open standard for representing geographical "

"It is important to note that behind the scenes, Bokeh converts the "
"GeoJSON coordinates into columns called `x` and `y` or `xs` and `ys`) "
"(depending on whether the features are Points, Lines, MultiLines, "
"Polygons or MultiPolygons). *Properties with clashing names will be "
"overridden when the GeoJSON is converted, and should be avoided*."
