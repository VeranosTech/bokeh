"used in the first example. The second example also adds in calls to "
"|Figure.circle| to display circle and line glyphs together on the same "

"|fill_props|, and |text_props| to control their appearance. All of these "

"**Guides** are visual aids that help users judge distances, angles, etc. "
"These include grid lines or bands, axes (such as linear, log, or "
"datetime) that may have ticks and tick labels as well. **Annotations** "
