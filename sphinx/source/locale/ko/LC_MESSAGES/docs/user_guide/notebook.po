"If you want to run a Bokeh plot that utilizes the python-based Bokeh "
"server, there are some additional steps you must follow to enable network"
" connectivity between the client browser and the Bokeh server running in "
"the JupyterLab cell.  This is because your browser needs to connect to "
"the port the Bokeh server is listening on, but JupyterHub is acting as a "
"reverse proxy between your browser and your JupyterLab container."

#: ../../source/docs/user_guide/notebook.rst:59

"First, you must install the \"nbserverproxy\" server extension (requires "
"python3).  This can be done by running the command: ``pip install "
"nbserverproxy && jupyter serverextension enable --py nbserverproxy``."

"Second, you must define a function to help create the URL that the "
"browser uses to connect to the Bokeh server.  This will be passed into "
"|show| in the final step.  A reference implementation is provided here, "
"although you must either modify it or define the environment variable "
"``EXTERNAL_URL`` to the URL of your JupyterHub installation.  By default,"
" JupyterHub will set ``JUPYTERHUB_SERVICE_PREFIX``."

"Finally, you can pass the function you defined in step 2 to |show| as the"
