"One of the central design principals of Bokeh is that, regardless of how "
"the plot creation code is spelled in Python (or other languages), the "
"result is an object graph that encompasses all the visual and data "
"aspects of the scene. Furthermore, this *scene graph* is to be "
"serialized, and it is this serialized graph that the client library "
"BokehJS uses to render the plot. The low-level objects that comprise a "
"Bokeh scene graph are called :ref:`Models <bokeh.model>`."

"As a concrete example, consider a column layout with ``Slider`` and "
