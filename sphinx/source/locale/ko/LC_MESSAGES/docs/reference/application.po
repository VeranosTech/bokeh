"A *Bokeh Application* is a lightweight factory for creating Bokeh "
"Documents. For example, whenever a new client connects to a Bokeh Server,"
" the server uses the ``Application`` to generate a unique new document, "
"to service  the client session. The application performs this task by "
"invoking the ``modify_document`` method of any ``Handler`` objects that "
"it is configured with."
