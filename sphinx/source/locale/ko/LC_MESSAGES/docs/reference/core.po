"The ``bokeh.core`` package provides modules that are useful for "
"implementing Bokeh itself. Documentation for all of them can be accessed "
"through the sidebar menu. Most of the modules here are probably not of "
"general interest to most users. However, some are more useful, especially"
" to anyone writing custom extensions to Bokeh. These are listed below:"

"Properties on Bokeh models support automatic type validation, including "
"specifying and validating enumerated values. There are many enumerations "
"used across Bokeh. This section has documentation on all the ones that "
"are built-in, as well as information about how to create new ones."

"The fundamental building block of Bokeh apps and documents is the Bokeh "
"models, for instance plots, ranges, axes, etc. Bokeh models are comrpised"
" of properties, which are named attributes with specified types. Model "
"properties can automatically validate and serialize themselves. This "
"section describes all the property types that can be attached to Bokeh "
"models, which is of interest when creating custom extensions."

"Some collections of properties appear together often. Property mixins are"
" groups of properties, such as a ``fill_color`` and ``fill_alpha``, that "
"make up a single unit that can be easily applied to Bokeh models all at "
"once."

"When serializing a Document for use by BokehJS, the Bokeh python library "
"attempts to detect potential or actual usage problems. These are reported"
" as validation warnings or errors, which have unique numeric codes and "
"names associated with them. This section is useful to find out more "
"specifics about such warnings and errors."
