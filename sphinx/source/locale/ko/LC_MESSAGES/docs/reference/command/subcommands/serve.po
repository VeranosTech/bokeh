"Typically, each browser tab connected to a Bokeh server will have its own"
" session ID. When the server generates an ID, it will make it "
"cryptographically unguessable. This keeps users from accessing one "
"another's sessions."
msgstr ""

#: bokeh.command.subcommands.serve:195 of

"To control who can use a Bokeh application, the server can sign sessions "
"with a secret key and reject \"made up\" session names. There are three "
"modes, controlled by the ``--session-ids`` argument:"
msgstr ""

#: bokeh.command.subcommands.serve:204 of
msgid "The available modes are: unsigned, signed or external-signed"
msgstr ""

#: bokeh.command.subcommands.serve:206 of
msgid ""
"In ``unsigned`` mode, the server will accept any session ID provided to "
"it in the URL. For example, ``http://localhost/app_script?bokeh-session-"
"id=foo`` will create a session ``foo``. In ``unsigned`` mode, if the "
"session ID isn't provided with ``?bokeh-session-id=`` in the URL, the "
"server will still generate a cryptographically-unguessable ID. However, "
"the server allows clients to create guessable or deliberately-shared "
"sessions if they want to."
msgstr ""

#: bokeh.command.subcommands.serve:215 of
msgid ""
"``unsigned`` mode is most useful when the server is running locally for "
"development, for example you can have multiple processes access a fixed "
"session name such as ``default``. ``unsigned`` mode is also convenient "
"because there's no need to generate or configure a secret key."
msgstr ""

#: bokeh.command.subcommands.serve:221 of
msgid ""
"In ``signed`` mode, the session ID must be in a special format and signed"
" with a secret key. Attempts to use the application with an invalid "
"session ID will fail, but if no ``?bokeh-session-id=`` parameter is "
"provided, the server will generate a fresh, signed session ID. The result"
" of ``signed`` mode is that only secure session IDs are allowed but "
"anyone can connect to the server."
msgstr ""

#: bokeh.command.subcommands.serve:228 of
msgid ""
"In ``external-signed`` mode, the session ID must be signed but the server"
" itself won't generate a session ID; the ``?bokeh-session-id=`` parameter"
" will be required. To use this mode, you would need some sort of external"
" process (such as another web app) which would use the "
"``bokeh.util.session_id.generate_session_id()`` function to create valid "
"session IDs. The external process and the Bokeh server must share the "
"same ``BOKEH_SECRET_KEY`` environment variable."
msgstr ""

#: bokeh.command.subcommands.serve:237 of
msgid ""
"``external-signed`` mode is useful if you want another process to "
"authenticate access to the Bokeh server; if someone is permitted to use "
"the Bokeh application, you would generate a session ID for them, then "
"redirect them to the Bokeh server with that valid session ID. If you "
"don't generate a session ID for someone, then they can't load the app "
"from the Bokeh server."
msgstr ""

#: bokeh.command.subcommands.serve:244 of
msgid ""
"In both ``signed`` and ``external-signed`` mode, the secret key must be "
"kept secret; anyone with the key can generate a valid session ID."
msgstr ""

#: bokeh.command.subcommands.serve:248 of
msgid ""
"The secret key should be set in a ``BOKEH_SECRET_KEY`` environment "
"variable and should be a cryptographically random string with at least "
"256 bits (32 bytes) of entropy.  You can generate a new secret key with "
